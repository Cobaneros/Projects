This is my first approach to classes in Python. This program can: Read Polynomials from dict {degree: koeficient}, or a list of koeficients for power from 0 to len(list). Also you can input koeficients spliting it with ','. For example Polynomial(1,1) = Polynomial([1,1]) = Polinomial({0:1},{1:1}) = x + 1 You can make simple operations with class instances like: +, -, *, poly.degree(), poly(x), poly.der(n) # n derivative. Class supports iteration for non-zero koeficients. All koeficients supposed to be int. There are also two subclasses: QuadraticPolynomial and RealPolynomial. The first supports QuadraticPolynomial.solve() - returns real solutions. The second class is a class of odd degree polynomials. It supports RealPolynomial.get_root(). returns root with accuracy eps = 1e-6. I will be glad to recieve any feedback and advice.
